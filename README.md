# Kadenz

## Overview

Kadenz is being developed as my final project with [Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/). It is planned to be a fundraising web app for school groups, such as marching band boosters, using the Django framework.

## MVP target

- User login and registration
- Group CRUD
- Event CRUD
- RSVP to events

## Stretch goals

- Uploading of images to group pages
- Usage of map API on event pages
- CRUD functionality on sales, including:
  - Adding items, such as candy bars, to a sale
  - Allowing "guest" checkout
  - Integration of payment API, such as Stripe or Paypal
  - Association of purchase to specific student ID so that portions of the sale can go towards their "wallet"
