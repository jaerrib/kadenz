# Kadenz

## Overview

Kadenz was developed using the Django framework as my final project with [Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/). It was planned as a fundraising web app for school groups, such as marching band boosters. Stretch goals and other functionality will likely be added in the future.

## MVP target

- [x] User login and registration
- [x] Organization CRUD
- [x] Event CRUD
- [x] RSVP to events

## Stretch goals

- [ ] Uploading of images to group pages
- [x] Usage of map API on event pages
- [ ] CRUD functionality on sales, including:
  - Adding items, such as candy bars, to a sale
  - Allowing "guest" checkout
  - Integration of payment API, such as Stripe or Paypal
  - Association of purchase to specific student ID so that portions of the sale can go towards their "wallet"
