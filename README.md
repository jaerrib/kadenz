# Kadenz

## Overview

Kadenz was developed using the Django framework as my final project
with [Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/). It was planned as a fundraising
web app for school groups, such as marching band boosters. The original code has
been moved to
the [dojo_archive branch](https://github.com/jaerrib/kadenz/tree/dojo_archive)
for preservation.

> Please note that I am currently in the middle of rewriting the entire
> application as I have learned more about Django since I built the original in
> July 2023.

## Goals

The original application met the MVP goals that were set for the project but
used function-based views. This rewrite shifts to class-based ones while also
aiming to improve the project structure and UI/UX. Implementing the original
stretch goals are also part of the rewrite.
