                <h1>What can Kadenz do for you?</h1>
                <p class="fs-4">Kadenz was born out of personal
                    experience with high school marching band boosters and a
                    desire to make it easy to manage your organization's
                    fundraising events. We're starting out small. Right now,
                    you can post events like car washes or can drives, but
                    many exciting features, like online sales campaigns, are
                    planned for the future.</p>
                <p class="fst-italic">Sound interesting?</p>

            is not an actual business. This site was created as my final project
            with Coding Dojo in July 2023 and was subsequently rewritten in
            January 2024. All functionality is present, but the organizations
            and events are fictional. The source code can be viewed on
